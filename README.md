# Task-Runtime
Coding Challange

# Problem Description
Write a command line tool to schedule and optionally run a series of tasks in parallel,
according to a task list specification input in text.
The schema for the task list is:
name, duration in seconds, dependencies (as a list of names)
...
Include an option to validate the input task list and output the expected total runtime
without running the tasks.
Include a second option to run the tasks and determine the difference in the actual
runtime versus the expected runtime.
